Contributing to smrt
============================

How to contribute
-----------------

The preferred workflow for contributing to SMRT is to fork the
[master branch](https://github.com/tgsmith61591/smrt) on
GitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:

1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/tgsmith61591/smrt)
   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates
   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on
   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

2. Clone your fork of the SMRT repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/smrt.git
   $ cd smrt
   ```

3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch! 
   For more information, see the [GitFlow guide](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:

   ```bash
   $ git add modified_files
   $ git commit
   ```

   to record your changes in Git, then push the changes to your GitHub account with:

   ```bash
   $ git push -u origin my-feature
   ```

5. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
to create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.

(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the
[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)

Filing bugs
-----------
We use Github issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to
open an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.

It is recommended to check that your issue complies with the
following rules before submitting:

-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other
   [issues](https://github.com/tgsmith61591/smrt/issues?q=)
   or [pull requests](https://github.com/tgsmith61591/smrt/pulls?q=).

-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in
   appropriate code blocks.
   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).

-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well
   as your Python, smrt, scikit-learn, numpy, tensorflow and scipy versions. This information
   can be found by running the following code snippet:

  ```python
  import platform; print(platform.platform())
  import sys; print("Python", sys.version)
  import numpy; print("NumPy", numpy.__version__)
  import scipy; print("SciPy", scipy.__version__)
  import sklearn; print("Scikit-Learn", sklearn.__version__)
  import smrt; print("SMRT", smrt.__version__)
  import tensorflow; print("TensorFlow", tensorflow.__version__)
  ```

-  Please be specific about what estimators and/or functions are involved
   and the shape of the data, as appropriate; please include a
   [reproducible](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code snippet
   or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is raised,
   please provide the traceback.
